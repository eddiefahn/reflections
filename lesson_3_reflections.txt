1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

   This would make sense when I am part of a team where all members
   are making changes to the project on github. It would also make
   sense if I were working on the project from multiple devices.
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   By using pull, you can control the timing at which you receive new
   edits and contributions that others have committed. Otherwise, you
   could be working on the project and have the files changed
   automatically and unpredictably during your in-progress work.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another? 

   A fork makes a copy of a repository on github that you can
   control. Both the original and the copy are on github. A clone
   downloads a copy of a github repository to your local machine,
   allowing you to edit the files locally. A branch, whether local or
   remote, is a new version with a new feature or other change that
   you are working on.
