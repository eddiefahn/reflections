1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

   This would make sense when I am part of a team where all members
   are making changes to the project on github. It would also make
   sense if I were working on the project from multiple devices.
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   By using pull, you can control the timing at which you receive new
   edits and contributions that others have committed. Otherwise, you
   could be working on the project and have the files changed
   automatically and unpredictably during your in-progress work.
