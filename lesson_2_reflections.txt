1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?

   A .git directory (and perhaps some subdirectories) are
   created. Then some files to store metadata related to commits,
   branches, and so on are created, although they are likely to  be
   empty. 


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

   It lets you add files one by one to be tracked, but still commit
   them as a group. It also lets you change your mind before
   committing.
